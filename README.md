# Credit-Card-Validator
Validate a credit card by checksum and find if the card is VISA, MASTERCARD, or AMEX
I wrote this program from my computer science class. This is my own work. Please do not use this code as your own work for acedmecic credit.

*** following is for my own documentation ***

The project started off well, but seemed to get more and more complicated as I went.
I'm glad that the program works in the end, but I would like like to possible come back and clean it up a little. 

I had problems doing things in C that are easy in some other languages.
 - switch statement on strings
 - exponents in C need a function: pow(x, y)
 - appending things to arrays was difficult
 - I needed to think carefully to iterate through an array
